### unverified MEDIA LISTS

These media lists has been scraped by various online resourse. 
They are not:

  * Accurate (there are website that are not media list)
  * Updated (something is missing, something is expired)
  * Separated (is needed a separation between National and Local and Blog)

If your country is missing, you can provide your own list, or just ask to me because probaly I've soe scraped resource.

For sure, once I've uploaded here, need to be review by someone in the country, or someone expert about the country media, in order to perform the verification on separation.
