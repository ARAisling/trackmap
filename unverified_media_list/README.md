## MEDIA LISTS

These media lists has been scraped by various site, like wikipedia and other
online resources.

They can be **SERIOUSLY WRONG** about the news media usage in a country :(

In the media list under the name of 'unverified' there are:

  * missing some important media (please, update if you know about them)
  * some not-media website that need to be removed
  * and is needed a local-national separation among the media
