## MEDIA LISTS

These media lists has been scraped by various site, wikipedia and so on.

They can be **SERIOUSLY WRONG** about the news media usage in a country :(

The goal is **having under analysis the most navigated news media per country**, so iif you checks your country list and update with human input, the project can really appreciate.

### Future development

Eventually in the future an integration with the "top 30 Alexa site per country" can be done. And if you have already this list, or you want scrape if for me, just fork on github **<3**
