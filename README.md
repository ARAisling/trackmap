## You and Us

Hi, we **$XXXX**, need support for this project **$YYYYY**, in short, you've to run this virtual machine, we've to perform some tests (web connections to public website and traceroutes). For do that, the easiest way is that you start this virtual box
image and make the box run for a while.

We can connect back to the virtual box to get the data collected and to starts
the tests.


## Scripts role

These scripts are intented to be used:

  * from a decent linux uses able to install software and run a command line from a terminal (only one command, come on!)
  * from someone with an email address that can eventually receive some non-automatic emails by us
  * fome someone in a country of interest, because traceroute mean that we cannot run the tests from our network location: you internet has different paths of all the other, and we need to collect a lot of sample.
